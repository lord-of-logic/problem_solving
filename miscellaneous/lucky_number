//Lucky number is the number which is left out after deleting all the 2nd numbers in first interation, 3rd number in 
//second iteration and so on check until that number is no more deleted.
//Ex:
//1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 i=2
//1,3,5,7,9 i=3
//1,3,7,9 i=4
//1,3,7 i=5
//Hence 1,3,7 can no more be deleted and hence declare them as luck. Now given a number find out if it is lucky or not.
